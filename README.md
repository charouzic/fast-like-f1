# Formula 1 API

This project is made from pure joy and enthusiasm about Formula 1 after watching the Drive to Survive Netflix serie. 
It is dedicated to serve data about drivers, teams and many more in a conscise way so one does not need to spend hours
going through wikipedia and finding facts about Formula 1. Everything is in one place

It is also a playground for trying out the [FuncSharp](https://github.com/siroky/FuncSharp) library maintained and widely use by 
[Mews](mews.com) (Czech company within hospitality). It is using functional way of writing code, using immutable data structures, pattern matching
and many more cool stuf that functional langugues like Scala posses.
